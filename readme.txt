Allows a customer to award a referral to a specific affiliate at checkout

== Description ==

This plugin requires both [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") & [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). <strong>It will NOT function without them.</strong>

EDD Checkout Referrals allows a customer to select an affiliate at checkout to receive commission from their purchase. It's especially useful for sites whose affiliates are NPO (Nonprofit organizations). A customer can select the NPO from checkout, and that NPO will receive a commission on the sale. If an affiliate link is already being tracked (Eg /?ref=123, the affiliate list is not shown at checkout.

*Features:*

1. Shows a select menu at checkout (but only when a referral link is not used) that allows a customer to select an affiliate that their purchase will be credited to.
1. Adds a payment note to the EDD receipt showing the referral ID, amount recorded for affiliate, and affiliate's name
1. Allows a customer to search through the affiliate list at checkout
